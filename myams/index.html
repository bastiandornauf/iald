        <h2>How to use MobileYAMS</h2>
        <h3>draw</h3>
        <p>This button will draw a hand of 6 cards from the shuffled YAMS deck.</p>
        <h3>discard</h3>
        <p>This button is located on each card and will discard the card. When you have the allowed number of cards in hand the discard button will disappear.</p>
        <h3>hide all other cards</h3>
        <p>A click on the card header will show this card exclusive and hide all other cards. This is useful to show your opponent that you have this card and avoid him seeing your deck. Another click on the header will bring the deck back.</p>
        <h3>all cards</h3>
        <p>This button will show all cards in the YAMS deck. You do not need this in a game</p>
        <h3>menu off</h3>
        <p>To save screen estate and avoid unwanted button clicks you can disable the menu here. Warning: you only get the menu back when you reload the page - but you'll loose your deck when you do so.</p>
        <h3>rules &amp; help</h3>
        <p>Rules shows/hides the YAMS rules, help shows/hides this help text you are reading. </p>
        <h3>What is with the date?</h3>
        <p>This is thought as anti-cheating measure. Everytime you draw cards the time will be noted so your opponent could see if you would have redrawn objectives at the end of the game.</p>
